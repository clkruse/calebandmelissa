        <h1>THE INVITATION</h1>
        
        <p class="description">We were excited to create a wedding invite that could be a small piece of art. Here's how it was made.</p>

        <p>We worked with a local letterpress printer and artist, Li Jiang at <a href="https://lemoncheese.press/">Lemoncheese Press</a>, to design and print our invitations and see the steps along the way. It started with a sketch. We shared some ideas of what we had in mind, and Li drew a picture of what the print might look like. After a few conversations, we arrived at this concept. </p>

        </div>
        
        <p>From here, Li worked off of these references to create plates for each color present in the print. To do this, Li carefully etched away in an opaque sheet. Once complete, these sheets were laid over a photosensitive polymer and exposed to UV light. Any location in the sheet that was etched away allows light to shine onto the polymer and causes it to harden. The unexposed places are then rinsed away, leaving a raised surface for printing.</p>

        <p>Each invitation was carefully printed on luxurious cotton paper using a vintage letterpress machine. This technique creates a subtle, tactile impression that adds depth and character to the design.</p>
